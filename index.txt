The skiplist based Index has the following format on disk, 32 uints for each
node, that is one uint that rapresents the value pointer and 31 uint pointers
like so:

type Node struct{
	uint value
	Next [31]uint 
}

An allocator like data structure returns the actual node to from the uint which
is also known as NodeID.
On disk is represented as a compressed 48 bytes long record,composed by

-2 bytes that indicates the state of the record, deleted or ok
-8 bytes value non compressed to make so that comparisons are still possible
-4 bytes crc32 to verify validity 
-34 bytes Nex[31]uint compressed to save space 

|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| status 2 bytes | value 8 bytes | next[31] 34 bytes | crc32 4 bytes |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

The index has also an header struct the contains statistics

type Stats struct {
	Magic [16]byte // savatar tsdb 
	VersionMajor 	int8
	VersionMinor 	int8
	StatusOk     	uint16 
	NumberOfEntries uint 
	RecordSize   	uint 
}
