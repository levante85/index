done:
 - FIX the header update 

not done:
 - Complete transaction implementation 
 - Add a transaction manager to handle the rollback logic etc
 - Reimplement resize for the memory mapped store 
 - Check why writes using the builtin copy are so fast // unrealistic 

thinking:
 - Use multiple mappings for the same store ie, 68Gb diveded by 16Kb page are
   roughly equal to ~4000000 pages ...
